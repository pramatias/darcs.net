This directory is for scripts demonstrating where darcs is slow.  I'd like
to eventually stick a driver or makefile in here that runs the tests and
presents their timings in a nice format.  But for now, this is just a place
to stick cases that we'd like to see improved eventually.

I'd *love* to have scripts in here that would generate large repositories
or repositories with large files in them and/or long histories and time
various darcs operations on a whole range of repositories to determine how
darcs scales with regard to different parameters in both time and memory
use.

But that's a large project.  For now, this is just a warehouse for test
cases.

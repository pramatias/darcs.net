Darcs
=====
This is the source tree for darcs, a distributed version control system
written in Haskell.

For more information, visit the darcs web site:

   http://www.darcs.net


Compilation and Installation
============================

Building Darcs requires GHC, version 6.10.3 or higher. It also requires the
Cabal package, version 1.6 or higher.  The cabal-install package is also
recommended.

If you have the "cabal-install" package on your system (that is, there is a
"cabal" executable in your path), you can use the following command to create
an executable in ~/.cabal/bin/darcs (this will also automatically fetch and
build dependencies from the Hackage server).

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install

Otherwise, if you have the "cabal" package but not the "cabal-install"
package, run the following:

    $ runghc Setup configure
    $ runghc Setup build
    $ sudo runghc Setup install

You may also omit the last step and copy the darcs executable (found in
dist/build/darcs/darcs) to a location of your choosing.

More detailed instructions can be found at
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package>
including instructions on obtaining a copy of cabal-install.

Please also note that the cabal-based build by default requires the cURL
library (and development headers). If, for some reason, you cannot provide
cURL, please pass "-f-curl" to the configure step above.


Hacking
=======
For more information about darcs hacking and best practices please check
the darcs wiki at http://wiki.darcs.net

Of particular interest are the following documents:

Comments about do-notation warnings
===================================
You may find a number of comments (163 of them at the time of writing) looking
like:
-- Warning:  A do-notation statement discarded a result of type Whatever.
They signal warnings issued by GHC that have been automatically silenced.
See http://bugs.darcs.net/issue1988 for more detail.

These warnings were most certainly harmless, but who knows... If you stumble
upon one such comment, take a minute or two to check if it is really okay to
ignore the return value (look for "_ <- " on the line next to the comment).  If
everything is correct, please remove the comment and send a patch (mentioning
issue1988).  If it isn't, you have found a bug, congratulations!  Fix it, or
fill a bug report on http//bugs.darcs.net/.  Finally, if in doubt, leave it as
is.  Many thanks.

Testing
=======
For more information about the test suite, including how to run specific
tests please read tests/README.test_maintainers.txt.

Happy hacking!
